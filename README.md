The steps for translating the manifesto into a new language depend on a number of factors.

If you are translating to an “easy” language (e.g., one that uses the Latin alphabet) and have deep technical skills:

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and add me (`mhartl`) as a collaborator.
2. Install the `softcover` Ruby gem and get the document to build locally by following the instructions in [*The Softcover Book*](https://manual.softcover.io/book). (If your system isn't already configured as a Ruby development environment, see [*Learn Enough Dev Environment to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/dev-environment-tutorial).)
3. Edit the file `chapters/tau_manifesto.tex` to make the translation. See especially the section “[Foreign-language support](https://manual.softcover.io/book/customization#sec-foreign_language)” in the Softcover manual.
4. Once the translation is nearing completion, send email to michael@michaelhartl.com for further instructions.

If you are translating to a “hard” language (e.g., Russian or Chinese) or aren’t as comfortable with technology:

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and add me (`mhartl`) as a collaborator.
2. Edit the file `html/tau_manifesto.html` directly, taking care to preview it in a web browser to make sure it looks OK.
3. Once the translation is complete, send an email to michael@michaelhartl.com with the HTML attached as a separate file.
